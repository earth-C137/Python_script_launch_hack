# Python_script_launch_hack

Requirements: tmux

For some reason with conda, and even useing pyintaller.  I couldn't get my tkinter scripts to run easily.  Also, I always had a shell open.

This hack uses tmux to launch and run python script without opening a shell, and uses the conda base environment.
